# Welcome to my Fallout 4 Scripts and Batch Files and Whatever Else Repository

## Contributing

If you have a script or batch file you would like to contribute, create a new branch and submit a pull request.

New branches should be cloned from the main branch to ensure the most stable version of this repository is used as a base.

New branches should follow the naming convention of the script or cheat they are contributing.

ex: `git checkout -b batchfiles/reset_materials/more_materials` for a contribution to the `reset_materials` script or `git checkout -b scripts/spawn_cats` for a new script ie: **section/script_name/description**
