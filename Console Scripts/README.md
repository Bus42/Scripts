## Contributing

If you have a script you'd like to share, create it in this folder then create a section describing it in the `README` file.

## Documentation

### reset_materials.txt

This resets the number of most crafting materials to 999 in order to provide you with just about everything you need and avoid overcrowding the inventory with thousands of items.

### NPC boost

Vanilla NPC stats suck. This script will boost all stats of an NPC by 3 points.

Now your settlers' stats don't suck so bad!
