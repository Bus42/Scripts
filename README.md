# Welcome to my Fallout 4 Scripts and Batch Files and Whatever Else Repository

## Contributing

If you have a script or batch file you would like to contribute, create a new branch and submit a pull request.

New branches should be cloned from the main branch to ensure the most stable version of this repository is used as a base. `git clone -b main`

New branches should follow the naming convention of the script or cheat they are contributing.
ex: 'git checkout -b batchfiles/reset_materials/more_materials' for a contribution to the reset_materials cheat or 'git checkout -b scripts/spawn_cats' for a new script ie: **section/script_name/description**
